              Nathaniel Paz founded SimplyPi with a vision to make quality
              education in mathematics and computer science accessible to
              everyone. As a student who struggled with these subjects early in
              his academic journey, Nathaniel understands firsthand the
              challenges many students face.

              With extensive experience in tutoring peers and leading study
              groups throughout his college years, Nathaniel developed a unique
              approach to breaking down complex concepts into simple, digestible
              piecesâ€”making learning as "simple as Pi."
